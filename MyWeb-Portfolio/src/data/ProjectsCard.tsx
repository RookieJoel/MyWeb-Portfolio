          Columbus Project: New Heaven is a turn-based strategy game inspired by
          Catan, developed as part of the Programming Methodology course
          @Chulalongkorn University. The game is designed using Java and JavaFX,
          implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as
          inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Set in a
          post-apocalyptic world, players take on the role of factions competing
          to colonize New Heaven, a habitable planet discovered after Earth's
          destruction. Players must strategically build structures, manage
          resources, and engage in combat to ensure their civilization's
          survival.
