          Columbus Project: New Heaven is a turn-based strategy game inspired by
          Catan, developed as part of the Programming Methodology course
          @Chulalongkorn University. The game is designed using Java and JavaFX,
          implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as
          inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Set in a
          post-apocalyptic world, players take on the role of factions competing
          to colonize New Heaven, a habitable planet discovered after Earth's
          destruction. Players must strategically build structures, manage
          resources, and engage in combat to ensure their civilization's
          survival.

          Welcome to ShopShap, a modern, responsive fashion storefront built as
          a mini-project to practice UI/UX design using the Svelte framework and
          Tailwind CSS.
          <br />
          <br />
          As someone passionate about both design and development, I wanted to
          challenge myself by learning Svelte, a fast and elegant JavaScript
          framework. Pairing it with Tailwind CSS allowed me to rapidly
          prototype beautiful, responsive layouts while keeping code
          maintainable and scalable. üß† My goal: Build something that looks
          great, works cleanly, and shows off how fun and powerful modern
          frontend tools can be.
