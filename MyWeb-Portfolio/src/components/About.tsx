            I love to work with short videos, especially TikTok, while coding.
            It helps me stay motivated and inspired. I find that the quick
            bursts of creativity and entertainment from TikTok keep my mind
            fresh and engaged. I enjoy watching coding tutorials, tech tips, and
            funny content that relates to programming. It adds a fun element to
            my coding sessions and helps me stay productive.

            Once upon a time, not so long ago, a young boy (that's me!) found
            himself living in a world on the cusp of a technological revolution.
            It was a time when devices were beginning to weave themselves into
            the very fabric of our lives, subtly, yet profoundly. And then, a
            pivotal moment arrived, courtesy of my father, a university
            professor. He introduced me to something that would forever alter my
            trajectory: a computer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Oh, what a marvel that machine was! Even though my initial
            interactions were confined to the thrilling realm of video games, a
            profound realization stirred within me: this magical box, this
            intricate contraption, held the power to transform everything. From
            that moment on, a quiet fascination with the art and science of
            computing began to blossom.
            <br />
            <br />
            This burgeoning interest eventually led me down an unexpected path â€“
            the Computer Olympiad. To be completely honest, I had virtually no
            background in competitive programming at the time. (Yes, you read
            that right â€“ a blend of sheer mathematics and a relentless
            seven-year dive into past exam papers somehow paved my way in!) But
            here I was, having reached this stage, and a fierce determination
            ignited within me. I decided to dive in,
            <br />
            <br />
            headfirst. And that, my friends, was the true beginning. It was the
            spark that ignited my passion for leveraging knowledge and
            capabilities â€“ from my communication skills to my technical prowess
            â€“ to solve complex problems. All with the very same kind of device
            that had first cast its spell on my young, impressionable mind.
